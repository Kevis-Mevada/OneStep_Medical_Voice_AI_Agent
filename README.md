  <h2>Project Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Onestep Medical Voice AI is a secure, voice-based health guidance web application
    that allows users to interact with an AI assistant using natural speech.
    The system processes voice input in real time and provides calm, non-diagnostic
    medical guidance focused on wellness, lifestyle, diet, and exercise.
  </p>
  <p>
    The application follows strict medical safety, privacy, and ethical guidelines
    and does not replace licensed healthcare professionals. It is designed to be
    scalable, privacy-focused, and suitable for academic, professional, and
    startup-level use.
